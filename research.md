## 3. Playbook for 'drnk' Digital Traction

Based on the research, here is how 'drnk' can win:

1.  **Gamification (The "Blue Tokai" angle)**:
    *   Since 'drnk' is Gen Z focused, build a "Streak" feature or "Slushy Meter" in the app.
    *   Reward social shares: "Post a story, get 10% off next shake".

2.  **Vibe-First UI (The "Subko/Veronica's" angle)**:
    *   The website/web-app should feel "Futuristic" and "Animated". Avoid static menus. Use micro-animations (bubbling effects, neon glows).

3.  **Community Hub**:
    *   Event Calendar: "Open Mic Nights", "Gaming Tournaments" listed clearly.
    *   "Secret Menu": Unlockable items only available via the website/webapp to drive traffic there.

## 4. Technical Recommendations
*   **Web App**: Next.js (fast, SEO friendly) with Framer Motion (for those cool animations).
*   **Features**:
    *   Digital Loyalty Card (Apple Wallet integration is a huge plus).
    *   QR Ordering for tables (reduces friction).
